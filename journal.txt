1. How to get list of restaurants given address
	-> check mimic GET request sent when doordash landing page enters address
		-> cannot tell from network details what the GET request is. Maybe it's hidden?
	-> if i can mimic http requests sent...then i can mimic 
		GET request (get restuarants and restaurant meal)
		POST request (submit order)
		GET request (order status)
2. alternative -> make a chrome extension that randomly selects for doordash
3. GET restaurants from doordash
	- https://www.doordash.com/graphql?operation=homePageFacetFeed
	- response: https://gist.github.com/llj0824/5a459a11da16e7f9f739040dfb123bb8
	- TODO: relies on cookies 
		-> only need: "ddweb_session_id=e4405ddf-59b0-40ee-893c-16525c4bef3f:1;"
	- question what is the cookie generation flow
	-> fuck it...use a headless browser...
4. copy chrome network request to postmate
	-> chrome::network::request -> copy -> copy as cURL
	-> postman::import::rawText -> past cURL
DECISION -> use headless browser
